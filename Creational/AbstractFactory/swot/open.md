Hello my name is Ray . I am the Ray in The Ray Code
In this video I will be covering the Abstract Factory design pattern
I will be using C#

I've used C# in my career history and I have enjoyed it 

For this pattern I will examine why a C# developer would study this pattern

Cover the UML/ORM figure that was given by the Gang of 4

give you a code demonstation of which you may find the code used in this video posted at my GitHub site And have 

given a SWOT an analysis of the pattern

I have put time stamps in the margin so you may navigate to the section you desire most

My favorite is the SWOT analysis 

I have used other programming languages to cover this this same design pattern..

And I have also USED THIS programming language C# for ALL the other design patterns that were given by the gang of four
