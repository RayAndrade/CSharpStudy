Hello, my name is Ray and I’m the ‘Ray’ in TheRayCode.

Welcome to the start of my video series I plan to create in which I plan to survey the 23 design patterns as presented by the Gang of Four
 in their famous book Elements of Reusable  Object Oriented Software in the programming language XX.

So Subscribe and you will not miss an video of the project.

You will also be able to find the code that I use posted at my GitHub site so you may play around with it your self and the code should be heavily commented.

You can also find the code at my website TheRayCode.ORG 
and you may also find a course that I’m putting together on TheRayCode.COM. Notice that I maintain both the . ORG and .COM ..
