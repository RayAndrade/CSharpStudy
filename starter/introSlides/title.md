Hello, I Ray the Ray in TheRayCode
In this video, I plan to reveiw the Creational desing Pattern known as Factory.

I will be using C++

I produce and make other videos using other programing languages like C++, Java PHP but, for this video I will be using C#

In this video, I try to cover the whole aspect of this pattern.

I have divided this videio in to different sections.

I start with a list of reasons why a deveoper would want to study this pattern

I show you the UML that the Gang of Four gave in their book elements of reuable code

I provide a code example. I also post the code at my github site and at my own web site TheRayCode.ORG

I also us .com , but that's for another project I am woking on.

And then I proform a SWOT analys as ro why a developer would want to study this pattern.
